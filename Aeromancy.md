### Still the Air
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

Silence descends on the target space. No sound emanates from inside it and no sound from outside reaches into it. Any activity that requires vocalizations performed inside the target space, such as the casting of spells, has no effect. Alternatively, you can expend the casting of this spell to target up to three creatures in reach. Each gains the Silent trait for 1 hour.

### Wind Blast
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One creature or object within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You gather the wind and release it to go screaming away from you. If you target an object and the object is secured, it takes 2d6 damage. An unsecured object is pushed 1d6 yards. If you target a creature, make a Will roll against the target’s Strength. On a success, the target takes 1d6 damage, is pushed 1d6 yards, and falls prone. On a critical success, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage.

### Wind Walk
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You find purchase for your steps in the air. You can move in any direction and remain there. If you fail to stand on a solid surface that can support your weight when the spell ends, you fall.

### Wind Wall
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One line-shaped space, up to 10 yards wide, 10 yards tall, and 1 yard thick originating from a point within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Strong wind blows through the target space. The noise it creates drowns out all sounds quieter than a shout. A creature that would move through the space makes a Strength roll, rolling with 1 boon for each point of Size above 3. On a failure, the creature is pushed back to the nearest empty space and its Speed becomes 0 until the end of the round. Finally, the wind imposes 3 banes on rolls to attack targets behind the target space using ranged attacks.

### Gale Force Winds
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to three contiguous Size 5 spaces, all within 30 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Deadly winds blow through the target spaces. In addition to the normal effects created by wind, each creature in a target space takes 2d6 damage when you cast the spell and again at the start of each of your turns. When an injured, Strength impaired, stunned, unconscious, or weakened creature starts its turn in one of the target spaces, the wind pushes it 5 yards. Finally, the wind increases the number of banes imposed on rolls to attack to 3, if either the attacker or the target of the attack are in a target space.

---

### Unexpected Updraft
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A deadly gust of wind throws everything inside the target space up into the air. Each Size 3 or smaller creature and unsecured object in the target space flies 10 yards straight up and then falls. If an obstacle would prevent the creature or object from flying the full distance, it slams into the obstacle, taking 1d6 damage for each yard it was prevented from moving. Creatures suffer the normal effects from landing after a fall.

---

### Lightning Bolt
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One creature or object within 30 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You hurl a crackling bolt of lightning from your hand. The target takes 4d6 damage. Then, make a Will roll with 1 boon against the target’s Agility. On a success, the target takes an extra 4d6 damage. On a critical success, the target also catches fire and becomes vulnerable (luck ends both).

---

### Sword of Air
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One sword or sword-like weapon you hold  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

Elemental air flows into the sword so that it moans whenever you swing it. When you attack with the weapon, you can choose the target from among those within 5 yards of you (the sword leaps from your hand, strikes, and returns), use any attribute for the roll to attack, and roll with 1 boon. The sword’s damage increases by 2d6. Finally, while you hold the sword you increase your Speed by 3 and you have the Strider movement trait.

A powerful wind blows around you. The wind increases your Speed by 6 and grants you the Slippery trait. In addition, it imposes 3 banes on rolls to attack you and grants you 1 boon on Agility rolls. Finally, whenever you stop moving after you run, you create a thunderous noise that deals 1d6 damage to each creature and object within 1 yard of you. A creature makes a Strength roll. On a success, the creature takes no damage. On a failure, the creature becomes deafened until the end of your next turn and is pushed 1 yard.

## Master Spells

### Become the Wind
**Castings:** 3, reaction at the start of your turn  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You transform into a being formed from semi-solid air. While in this form, you are invisible, have the Fly and Hover traits, and you take half damage from ordinary sources. Finally, you can move through any opening wide enough to permit the passage of air.

### Cloud Chariot
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual  
**Target:** One empty Size 3 space on the ground within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

Mist forms in the target space, gradually taking the shape of a chariot drawn by four steeds. Although they appear to be made from water vapor, they are solid. The chariot is a vehicle that can hold any number of creatures whose total Size is 10 or less. It has Speed 8 and has the Fly trait. Anything in the chariot when the spell ends gently floats down to land on the nearest surface under it that can bear its weight.

### Control Weather
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual  
**Target:** A space, 100 miles long and wide, 10 miles high, resting on the ground with you at the center  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

You change the weather in the target space. Typical changes to the weather are described below; other effects might be possible, with the Sage’s consent and with effects determined by the Sage.

- The temperature climbs until unprotected creatures in the area become affected by exposure. The increase in heat causes snow and ice to melt after a few minutes, and steam creates moderate obscurement in all spaces containing the melting snow and ice for 1 hour. The sudden appearance of liquid water might cause flooding, as the Sage decides.  
- The temperature drops until unprotected creatures in the area become affected by exposure. The increase in cold causes liquid water to freeze and precipitation to fall as snow or ice. The sudden temperature change could cause containers that hold liquid to burst.  
- Heavy clouds gather above you and release precipitation in a form suitable for the season. You determine the intensity of the precipitation, from a gentle mist to a torrential downpour. Falling snow and ice might create areas of challenging terrain, and heavy rain can cause flooding.  
- A storm rages through the area, causing heavy rain, hail, wind, lightning, and thunder. While you can see the storm, you can use an action to call down a bolt of lightning to strike a creature or object you can see. The target takes 5d6 damage and makes an Agility roll. On a failure, it takes an extra 5d6 damage. After you call down the lightning, you can do so again after 1d6 minutes.  
- You cause strong wind to blow through the area. The wind might uproot trees, flatten wooden structures, and make travel in the area impossible, as you choose.  
- You can create clouds in the sky or remove them. You can shape the clouds so that they look like castles, creatures, or even words. You can change the color of the sky, make it seem as if the stars have changed position, or dim the light of the sun so that it appears eclipsed. You can make the moon appear in any phase you choose.

### Leaping Lightning
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to five creatures or objects all within a Size 5 space within 30 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A hissing, spitting bolt of lightning leaps from your outstretched hand. Choose one of the targets and make a Will roll with 1 boon against its Agility. On a success, the target takes 20d6 damage. On a critical success, the target catches fire and becomes vulnerable (luck ends both). Then, you repeat the roll against each other target, one at a time. An individual creature or object can be targeted just once with this spell. On a success, the second target takes 15d6 damage, the third takes 10d6 damage, the fourth takes 5d6 damage, and the fifth takes 1d6 damage. On a critical success, the target catches fire and becomes vulnerable (luck ends both).

### Summon Air Elemental
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 2 space within 5 yards

### Unleash Cyclone
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space within 20 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A cyclone forms in the target space and moves up to 20 yards before dissipating. Each object in the cyclone’s space when it appears or whose space the cyclone enters is caught in its winds. A creature or object can be affected just once. Each object takes 13d6 damage, and an unsecured object flies 2d6 yards away from the cyclone in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cyclone’s space when it appears or whose space the cyclone enters takes 5d6 damage, and makes a Strength roll. On a failure, the creature takes an extra 5d6 damage, flies 2d6 yards away from the cyclone, and lands prone. If this damage causes the creature to become injured or the creature was already injured, it makes a Will roll with 1 bane. On a failure, it becomes stunned until the end of your next turn.
