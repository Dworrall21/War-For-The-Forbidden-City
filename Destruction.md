## Master Spells

### All-Consuming Sphere
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Darkness bleeds from you to form a perfect sphere with a radius of one-and-a-half times your height. You can see normally from within the sphere, but it blocks all light from reaching inside. The sphere reduces damage from thrown weapons or projectiles used against you to 0 and destroys them.

The sphere moves with you when you move, carving a groove on any surface you cross. When the sphere moves to within 1 yard of a creature or into an object in your path, an object loses 10d6 Health and a creature makes an Agility roll. On a failure, the creature takes 10d6 damage. Anything whose Health is reduced to 0 by the sphere disappears, erased from existence.

---

### Annihilation Stone
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 1/4 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

A sinister, black stone appears in the space. It throbs. At the end of each round, the rock pulses and releases energy that deals 8d6 damage to each object within 5 yards of it. Each creature within 5 yards of it takes 4d6 damage, and makes a Strength roll. On a failure, the creature takes an extra 4d6 damage. Anything incapacitated or destroyed by this damage evaporates into mist that disperses at the end of the next round.

---

### Disintegration
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature or object within 30 yards; you need neither line of sight nor line of effect to the target  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You fling a black beam from your hand. Make an Intellect roll against the target’s Agility. On a success, the target takes 30d6 damage. If it is incapacitated or destroyed by this damage, the target disappears, erased from existence. On a failure, the beam misses but sweeps through a Size 5 space centered on the target, dealing 10d6 damage to each other creature and object in the space, also erasing from existence anything incapacitated or destroyed by this damage. A creature makes a luck roll. On a success, the creature takes no damage.

---

### Entropic Doom
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Each creature inside one Size 5 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

For each creature inside the target space, separately make an Intellect roll against its Agility. On a success, the target becomes confused and vulnerable for 1 minute. On a critical success, it also becomes cursed for as long as it is vulnerable. Until these afflictions end, it takes 5d6 damage at the end of each of its turns. Any creature incapacitated by this damage collapses into a puddle of black liquid and dies.

---

### Greater Ruin
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature or object within 30 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You level your finger at the target and speak a word of terrible ruin. The target takes 15d6 damage.

---

### Singularity
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 1/4 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Light bends around the target space as a 1-foot-radius black sphere appears and hovers there. Anything that touches the sphere loses 30 Health and disappears utterly if reduced to 0 Health.

The sphere gobbles up the air around it, causing strong wind (see *Shadow*, Chapter 2) to blow toward it from 10 yards away until the spell ends. The wind is sufficient to carry lightweight unsecured objects in the area toward the sphere. Larger, heavier unsecured objects slide toward the sphere at the end of each round. Make a luck roll and, on a success, the objects fall into the sphere.

The wind makes the affected area challenging terrain. Any creature in the area that attempts to leave makes a Strength roll and, on a failure, stops at the edge of the area and becomes held until the start of their next turn.

Each creature in the affected area at the end of each round until the spell ends makes a Strength roll. On a failure, it is pulled toward the sphere and becomes held until it overcomes the affliction with a successful Strength roll. If the target was already held, it ends the affliction and falls into the sphere.

Any creature that touches the sphere and has Health remaining teleports to an empty space of its choice within 15 yards of the sphere. For an object that touches the sphere and is not destroyed, you decide where it appears in range.
