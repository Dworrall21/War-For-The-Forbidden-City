## Novice Spells

### Anarchic Blast
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

From your open hand explodes multicolored light. Make an Intellect or Will roll against the target’s Agility. On a success, roll 2d6. The sum of this roll tells you how many dice you roll for damage. If the target becomes injured, roll a d6 and find the result on the following list to see what else happens:

| D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | You take the same amount of damage that the target took and then roll on the Wild Magic Effects table (Shadow, page 89) to determine additional effects. |
| 2–5 | Each creature within 1 yard of the target takes 1d6 damage and makes a Strength roll. On a failure, the creature takes an extra 1d6 damage. |
| 6 | Roll 1d6. The number rolled determines the number of dice you roll to determine the extra damage the target takes. |

If you get a failure on your attribute roll, energy spills from you out to a distance of 1d6 × 5 yards. You and each creature and object in range takes 1d6 damage.

### Chaos Sphere
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 1 space within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

A tumescent, nacreous sphere appears in the target space. At the end of each round, make a luck roll. On a success, the energy spreads out from the sphere to a range of 1d6 yards. Each creature and object in the area takes 1d6 damage and becomes confused until the end of the next round. If you get a failure, the spell ends early and you roll a d20 and find the result on the Wild Magic Effects table (Shadow, page 89).

### Cheat Death
**Castings:** 1, reaction when you become injured or incapacitated  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You heal 2d6 damage and make a luck roll. On a success, you teleport to an empty space of your choice within 50 yards. On a failure, you teleport to an empty space with a surface that can support you of the Sage’s choice within 1d20 × 5 yards.

### Flickering Form
**Castings:** 1, reaction when a creature gets a success on a roll to attack you  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You reduce the damage from the attack by 1d6. Then, until the spell ends, you have the Slippery trait and when a creature gets a success on a roll to attack you, the roll counts as a failure instead if the result is an even number.

---

### Magical Wellspring
**Castings:** 1, reaction when you cast a spell  
**Target:** One Size 5 space centered on you  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

The magic flooding into the target space fills the air with eerie noises, flashing colors, and other odd phenomena. When a creature in the target space produces a magical effect, the creature makes the attribute roll, if any, with 1 boon, and targets of the effect make the roll to resist the effect, if any, with 1 bane. Also, any magical effect that deals or heals damage in the space deals or heals an extra 1d6 damage. However, at the end of each round, you make a luck roll. On a failure, roll a d20 and find the result on the Wild Magic Effects table (Shadow, page 89). The spell then ends.

### Warped Space
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 15 space centered on you  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Reality warps out of true in the target space. Whenever a creature in it moves, roll a d6 and consult the following list:

| D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | The creature becomes confused and held until the start of its next turn. |
| 2 | The creature makes a luck roll. On a success, it teleports to an empty space of its choice anywhere in the target space. On a failure, it teleports to an empty space of your choice in the target space. |
| 3 | The creature moves normally. |
| 4 | A weird orb flies toward a randomly determined creature in the target space. The creature makes an Agility roll. On a failure, the creature is struck by the orb and takes 1d6 damage. |
| 5 | The creature makes a luck roll. On a success, the creature doubles its Speed until the end of its next turn. On a failure, it becomes slowed until the end of its next turn. |
| 6 | The creature disappears into the Void until the end of the round. When the creature returns, it makes a luck roll. On a success, it reappears in an empty space of its choice within 30 yards of the one it left. On a failure, you choose the space where the creature reappears. In either case, the creature rolls a d20. On a 13, it becomes possessed by a formless demon. The Sage has rules for this creature (see Secrets, Chapter 3). |

**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** 1d6 enemies within 30 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Magic bursts from you taking the form of flailing tentacles that then disappear. If the spell would target more enemies than there are eligible targets, you become a target of this spell. For each target, roll a d6 and refer to the following list:

|----|--------|
| 1 | The target heals 4d6 damage. |

| 6 | The target takes 12d6 damage, and you roll on the Wild Magic Effects table (Shadow, page 89) to see what else happens. |

A target makes a luck roll. On a success, it halves the amount of damage healed or taken from the result and the affliction ends.

**Castings:** 1, reaction when you move 1 yard  
**Target:** You

You flicker out of existence. Target one empty space within 10 yards. You teleport to that space. Then, for the spell’s duration, whenever a creature within 5 yards of you makes an attribute roll or a luck roll, it rolls an additional d20 and you roll a d6. If you roll a 3 or lower on the d6, the creature uses the lower number it rolled. If you roll a 4 or higher, the creature uses the higher number instead.
