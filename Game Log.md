### ðŸ“Œ Tips

- Keep **titles short** and **events concise**, like session summaries.  
- You can link to related markdown pages (e.g., NPCs, quests, locations) using standard `[Name](../path/file.md)` syntax.  
- Add rows as needed â€” **newest entries can go at the top or bottom**, depending on your preferred reading order.  
- Use this in combination with your armor, weapons, and character sheets for a fully browsable GitHub campaign vault.
