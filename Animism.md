**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One space, 3 yards wide and 10 yards long, originating from a point you can reach

If there are two possible spaces, you choose. A creature moved in this way makes an Agility roll. On a failure, it falls prone. Each unsecured object in the target space moves to the nearest empty space to the one it leaves, with you choosing if there are multiple eligible destination spaces.

### Awaken Genius Loci
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 15 space centered on you  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You awaken the spirit of place who turns its environs against your enemies.

### Standing Stones
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual  
**Target:** A Size 10 space on the ground and centered on you  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The ground rumbles as eight large stones, each 4 yards tall, 3 yards wide, and 1 yard thick, rise from the ground to form a circle around you. Each stone weighs 33 tons. The stones shed dim or faint light in a color you choose, or shed no light at all. If you cast this spell to produce this effect again, the stones sink back into the earth and rise from the ground where you cast the spell.

Any creature other than your enemies that rests inside the circle heals 1d6 damage after each hour of resting. If such a creature rests continuously for 8 hours, it also regains 4d6 Health.

If you cast an Aeromancy, Animism, Cryomancy, Geomancy, Hydromancy, Primal, or Pyromancy spell inside the circle, and the spell produces an effect that lasts at least 1 minute, that effect lasts twice as long as normal. You make any roll for casting that spell with 1 boon and impose 1 bane on any roll to resist the casting.

Finally, if you are in the same world as the stones, you can use an action to expend a casting of this spell to teleport yourself, along with any allies you choose within 5 yards, into the circle.
