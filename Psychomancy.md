# Psychomancy

## Novice Spells

### Dancing Weapon
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One weapon within 5 yards that is neither worn nor carried by a creature other than you  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

The target weapon leaps into the air and hovers there. When you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns if you lack the confused, controlled, stunned, and unconscious afflictions, you can move the target weapon up to 10 yards. If you move the target more than 10 yards away from you, the spell ends early and the weapon falls to the ground.

You can attack with the target weapon as if you were holding it, but you use Will in place of the attribute you normally use and the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage. Finally, until the spell ends, the target counts as an off-hand weapon for the purpose of attacking with two weapons.

### Levitation
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to three creatures or objects inside one Size 5 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Each target rises 2 yards into the air and hangs in place. An unwilling target makes a Strength roll. On a success, the target ignores the effect. An affected target is Strength impaired, Agility impaired, and vulnerable until the spell ends. The target can move only by crawling and then only if it can reach a surface. On each of your turns, you can use an action to raise or lower the target by up to 2 yards.

### Link Minds
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Any number of allies inside a Size 10 space centered on you  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You hear the targets’ mental chatter as you link your mind to theirs. The spell ends early if you become confused, controlled, stunned, or unconscious. Each target can communicate telepathically with each other target provided they know at least one language, but need not have any languages in common, regardless of the distance between them.

In addition, any target that casts a spell can produce the spell’s effect from the space occupied by any other target.

Targets within 5 yards of each other are immune to the blinded, deafened, and confused afflictions unless everyone has the same affliction.

Finally, you can use a reaction to end the spell early when a target becomes stunned. The target ends the affliction on itself.

### Mental Stowaway
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Your consciousness beats at the door of the target’s mind. If the target has an Intellect score, you attempt to invade its mind. Make an Intellect roll against the target’s Will. On a success, you know the target’s exact location for the next 24 hours.

You can also use an action to perceive from the target’s body instead of your own until you use an action to switch perspectives. While you perceive from the target’s body, you see, hear, and otherwise perceive as if you were in the target’s space and perceive nothing from your own. In addition, the target grants you 1 boon on rolls you make against it.

If you failed your Intellect roll, you regain the expended casting of this spell after 1 minute.

### Mindwrack

## Expert Spells

### Crushing Thoughts
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Visions of death crowd your mind as you wrap the creature in bands of psychic force to crush the life from it. The target becomes held and Strength impaired for 1 minute but can end the afflictions early by overcoming them with a successful Strength roll. At the end of the round, if the target still has these afflictions, it takes 4d6 damage. In addition, while the target is within 15 yards and has these afflictions, you can use an action to deal 4d6 damage to it.

### Elude Perception
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to three creatures within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You erase yourself from the targets’ minds. Each becomes confused (luck ends). While a target is confused in this way, you are invisible and silent to it. The target can still detect you using other senses and observing the effects of your presence on your surroundings, such as a shadow you cast, an amount of water you displace, or the visible results of your actions.

---

### Erase Memories
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You reach into the creature’s mind to strip away its memories. Make an Intellect roll against the target’s Will. On a success, the target becomes confused (luck ends). You erase the most recent of the target’s memories so that it knows that time has passed but cannot ever recall what happened during that interval. You can erase up to 1 hour of memories. On a critical success, you can erase up to 24 hours.

If you fail the roll, the target becomes confused until the end of your next turn.

### Kinetic Strike
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature or object within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You concentrate your thoughts into an invisible force that smashes into the target. A target object takes 12d6 damage. A target creature takes 4d6 damage and you make a Will roll against its Strength. On a success, the target takes an extra 6d6 damage, is pushed 1d6 yards away from you, and becomes vulnerable until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, the target takes an extra 2d6 damage.

---

### Read Mind
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

If the creature has an Intellect score, you reach into its mind and sort through its thoughts. Make an Intellect roll with 1 boon against the target’s Will. On a success, the target becomes Intellect impaired for 1 minute. On a critical success, the target also becomes Will impaired for 1 minute. When you cast the spell, and again on each of your turns while the target is Intellect impaired, you can ask a question and the Sage answers based on what the target knows or thinks it knows. Alternatively, you can just search for any information, in which case the Sage reveals one thing in the target’s thoughts per round until the spell ends.

### Thought Cloud
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space centered on you  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Your mind scrapes from the ground debris and dust and lifts them up to form a cloud of light obscurement in the target space. You can see normally in the target space. The cloud moves with you, remaining centered on you. When you cast this spell and when you use an action to do so, you can sweep the cloud at one creature or object within the area. A creature takes 3d6 damage, while an object takes 6d6 damage. Against a creature, make a Will roll against its Strength. On a success, the creature takes an extra 3d6 damage. On a critical success, the creature also becomes blinded until the end of your next turn.
