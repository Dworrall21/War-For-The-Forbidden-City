### Eavesdrop
**Castings:** 3, you can cast without speaking  
**Target:** One Size 1/2 space within 30 yards; you need neither line of effect nor line of sight to the target  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

Your ears pop as they adjust to the spell’s effects. You hear from the target space as if you were there instead of wherever you happen to be.

### Experience Revelations
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you have dice, cards, tea leaves, or another implement of divination  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** Special (see the effect)  

You consult your implements of divination to gain insights about the future. When you finish the ritual, roll a d20 three times and note the number rolled on each die. At any time before you cast this spell again, you can expend one roll to replace the number rolled on a d20 with the number you expended. The spell ends when you expend the last roll or when you cast the spell again.

### Interpret Omen
**Castings:** 3, reaction when a creature within 5 yards makes an attribute roll or a luck roll  
**Target:** The creature that enabled the casting of this spell  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You caught a glimpse of the future and you use this knowledge to change fate. Either add 3 to or subtract 3 from the roll that enabled the casting of this spell.

### Locate Quarry
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

Name one creature or object you have seen at least once. During the ritual, you close your eyes and fix your mind on the subject. When you finish, if the creature or object named is within 1 mile of you, you know where it is. If you have handled the object or have something from the creature, such as a drop of blood, a lock of hair, or bit of nail, then you know the location of the creature or object if it is within 100 miles.

The spell reveals the location of the creature or object at the time you cast it, and you retain the knowledge of the location indefinitely, though the information might no longer be accurate if the creature later leaves the space that it occupied or someone later moves the object.

### Pronounce Doom
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You reveal some dreadful happening to befall the target. If the target can hear and understand you, it makes a Will roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute or until it overcomes the affliction with a successful Will roll. In addition, while frightened in this way, the target subtracts 5 from the result of any attribute roll and luck rolls it makes.

### Weal or Woe
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you have dice, cards, tea leaves, or another implement of divination  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You consult your implements of divination to discern the consequences of your next action. Describe a possible course of activity, such as “I open the door on the west wall,” “I pick the lock on the chest,” or “I talk to that man over there.” When you finish the ritual, make an Intellect roll. On a success, the Sage tells you truthfully if the activity is likely to have a good or bad outcome for you. If the Sage decides the chance for a good or bad outcome is more or less even, you receive an answer of “uncertain.” If you fail the roll, the Sage is free to answer truthfully, lie, or just give you an answer of uncertainty.

Regardless of the outcome of your roll, you make attribute rolls with 1 boon for the duration.

## Expert Spells

### Battle Prescience
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

Seeing a moment ahead into the future grants you advantages in battle. In combat, you make attribute rolls with 1 boon and impose 1 bane on rolls to attack you and on rolls made against you.

---

### Dreadful Ending Foretold
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to three creatures within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

To each target, you reveal how it will die; this revelation has the ring of truth. If the target can hear you and understand what you say, it becomes frightened of you for 24 hours or until it overcomes the affliction with a successful Will roll with 1 bane. While frightened in this way, whenever the target fails an attribute roll or luck roll, it grants 1 boon on rolls to attack it until the start of its next turn, and when the target takes damage, it takes an extra 1d6 damage.

---

### Omniscience
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

Your eyes cloud until they turn completely white. You ignore the effects of obscurement, and any effect that would conceal, disguise, or render invisible any creature or object in your line of sight. You see auras around creatures and objects affected by magic; you recognize illusions you see and can ignore them. Your vision can also pierce solid objects. You can see through 1 yard of wood, 1 foot of stone, or 1 inch of metal as if the intervening object were not there.  

Until the spell ends, though, when you get a critical failure, you see something awful in your periphery and become weakened until you overcome the affliction with a successful Will roll.

### Query the Sage
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you have dice, cards, tea leaves, or another implement of divination  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Using your implements of divination, you cast out your mind into the universe in the hopes of gaining an insight about the future. When you finish the ritual, ask the Sage one question. The Sage answers truthfully in one of the following ways: yes, no, true, false, unknown, or unclear. The Sage might give a more expansive answer to the question, perhaps offering it in the form of a riddle, but the essence of the answer is true.

---

### Remote View
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One Size 1/2 space within 60 yards; you need neither line of sight nor line of effect to the target  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

Your vision blurs for a moment. When it clears, you see from inside the target space as if you were there instead of where you happen to be. If you cast a spell while under the effects of this spell, you can choose that spell’s targets within range of the target space.

---

### Sure Strike
**Castings:** 1, reaction when you attack  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You see a clear path to strike the target. Add 20 to the result of your roll to attack. If the attack results in a critical success, the target takes an extra 6d6 damage.

## Master Spells

### Avoid Certain Death
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

You see how you might die. The first time you would become incapacitated or die before the spell ends, you ignore the damage or the effect that would have incapacitated or killed you. The spell then ends.

### Consult Power
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you have dice, cards, tea leaves, or another implement of divination  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You cast your senses out to the cosmos in hopes of gaining the information you seek. When you finish the ritual, choose one of the following options:

- Describe an event that occurred within the last month. You learn the identity of the individual most responsible for it.  
- Choose one object you have seen, touched, or read about. Provided the object is real, you always know its current location for 1 hour.  
- Describe one person you have seen at least once. You always know the person’s current location for 1 hour.  
- Learn one secret about a topic of your choice.  
- Request a clue or piece of information related to your quest and you learn something of the Sage’s choice.

---

### Foreknowledge
**Castings:** 1, reaction when you or an ally within 5 yards would make an attribute roll  
**Target:** You or the ally that enabled the casting of this spell  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You have seen previously this situation unfold and can respond accordingly. Rather than roll the dice, the target gains a critical success as the result of the roll.

---

### Precognition
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You open your mind to anticipate future happenings. You impose 1 bane on rolls against your attributes, you make attribute rolls and luck rolls with 1 boon, and you take half damage from ordinary sources. In addition, each ally within 5 yards that can hear and understand what you say makes attribute rolls with 1 boon.

---

### Prognostication
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you have dice, cards, tea leaves, or another implement of divination  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 12 hours  

You consult your implements of divination to glimpse the future. You learn of an event to occur at some point within the next 12 hours. At any time before the spell ends, you can decide you foresaw the moment, ending the spell and adding 5 to the results of all your attribute rolls and luck rolls for 1 minute. Until this effect ends, you subtract 5 from the result of any roll against you. If you fail a roll while under this effect, the effect ends early and you become confused (luck ends).

---

### Scry
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you have crystal ball, a decanter of still water, or a mirror  
**Target:** One Size 5 space you know to exist somewhere in the world; you need not have line of effect or line of sight to this space  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You concentrate on the required object and make an Intellect roll. If you use a crystal ball, you succeed automatically. If you use a mirror, you roll with 1 boon. On a success, an image of the space appears on the surface and remains for as long as you use an action each round to hold it there, up to 1 hour. The image shows a bird’s eye view of the target space, and you can swivel the image to see into the space from any angle. Also, sounds of normal conversation in the target space reach you as whispers, while shouts and other loud noises sound at the volume of normal conversation. You cannot make out whispers from the target space, however.

If you cast a spell while under the effects of this spell, you can choose that spell’s targets within range of this spell’s target space.

On a failed Intellect roll, you become Intellect impaired until after you rest.
