**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You roll the dice and they come up in your favor. You gain a pool of luck that lasts for the duration or until you expend the last of it. You generate this pool by making a luck roll and noting the result. If you roll a 10 or less, add 10 to the number you rolled.

Whenever you make an attribute roll or an attribute roll is made against you, you can spend luck from your pool and either add the amount spent to your roll or subtract it from the roll.
