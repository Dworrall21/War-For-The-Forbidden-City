The two creatures retain any afflictions they had before you cast the spell, but divide their damage total between them in any way you choose. The creatures consider each other to be their enemy. When one of them dies, the corpse of one merges with the other, at which point they add together their damage totals and their normal rules are restored.

### Polymorph
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 4 hours  

The target’s body bubbles, bends, and twists as it struggles to find its new form. You transform the target into one of the following forms. If you target yourself, you can use an action to switch your form into a different one, but you reduce the duration by 1 hour. Each time you transform in this way enables you to heal 3d6 damage.

- The target takes the form of a different individual, either a unique person of your own design or a duplicate of another individual. The person can be no more than a few feet taller or shorter than the target. If the new form has a different ancestry, the target gains the ancestry’s traits and loses its own ancestry traits. If the target duplicates another person, it uses the person’s Strength and Agility scores in place of its own.  
- The target transforms into some kind of animal of your choice but of its Size. Everything the target wears or carries transforms with it. In this form, the target uses its own rules with the following modifications. The target has the Keen Scent trait and has a natural weapon that deals 1d6 damage for each point of its Size (minimum 1d6). The target might gain additional traits, such as movement traits, based on its form. For example, if you turn the target into a winged animal, the target gains the Fly trait. Or, if you turn the target into a fish, it gains the Swimmer trait and can breathe while submerged in water.
