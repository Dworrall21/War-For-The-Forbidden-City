## Novice Spells

### All-Consuming Fires of Hell
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One creature within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Screams fill the air as the black fires gathered in your hands streak toward the target. Make an Intellect roll against its Agility. On a success, the target takes 3d6 damage and catches fire (luck ends); it makes rolls to end this effect with 1 bane. If your Intellect roll results in a failure, either the target takes 1d6 damage or you can choose to lose 2 Health to turn the failure into a success. On a critical success, you also regain the expended casting of this spell.

### Exquisite Agony
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Pain grips the target. Make an Intellect roll against the target’s Will. You can choose to lose 2 Health to make the roll with 1 boon. On a success, the target becomes cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, whenever the target falls prone, takes damage, or loses Health, it becomes weakened (luck ends). On a failure, you regain the expended casting of this spell after 1 minute. On a critical success, the effect lasts 1 hour instead of 1 minute.

### Flesh Blight
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One flesh-and-blood creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Blisters appear all over the target’s body. Make a Will roll against the target’s Strength. You can choose to lose 2 Health to make the roll with 1 boon. On a success, the target takes 2d6 damage and becomes cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, the target is also weakened.

If the target takes damage from an attack by a creature in its reach and the attacker’s weapon lacks the Long trait, a bubo on the target’s body bursts to spray the attacker. The attacker makes an Agility roll and, on a failure, becomes affected as if you had cast this spell on it.

If your Will roll results in a failure, you regain the expended casting of this spell after 1 minute.

### Insidious Vexation
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Dark splotches appear all over the target’s body and then fade. You can target additional creatures with this casting of the spell: lose 4 Health to target two creatures or 8 Health to target three. A target becomes cursed for the duration. While cursed in this way, each time the target gets a success on an attribute or luck roll, roll a d6 to see what happens:

| D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | The target falls prone. |
| 2 | The target takes 1d6 damage. |
| 3 | The target becomes weakened until the end of its next turn. |
| 4 | The target, or your choice of one of its allies within 5 yards of it, takes 2d6 damage. |
| 5 | The target, or your choice of one of its allies within 5 yards of it, becomes confused (luck ends). |
| 6 | The target, or your choice of one of its allies within 5 yards of it, takes 4d6 damage. |

### One True Love
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The target’s eyes turn black and then return to normal a moment later. Make an Intellect roll against its Will. On a success, the target sees you as its one true love for 1 hour. The target is your ally until you harm it, its friends or loved ones, or its property. The spell also ends if the target learns it is affected by this spell or witnesses you perform an act it would find objectionable. On a failure, the target becomes your enemy if it is not already and, henceforth, makes rolls against you with 1 boon. After you cast this spell, you can choose to lose 2 Health and regain the expended casting.

### Recall Soul
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual  
**Target:** One dead creature within reach  
**Duration:** Special (see the effect)  

The soul belonging to the target returns to its body, causing it to animate and behave in a manner appropriate to someone that knows it has died and desperately wants to live. Each creature that can see the target, other than you, makes a Will roll. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened of the target until the spell ends or the creature overcomes the affliction with a successful Will roll.

When you cast the spell, and once each round on your turn, you can ask the soul one question. The soul answers truthfully by speaking with the target’s mouth, gesturing, or writing, and uses the knowledge it had in life. When not answering queries, it blubbers, complains, and begs for help.

At the end of each round, roll a d6. On any number other than 6, the spell ends unless you choose to lose 2 Health.

### Appalling Hemorrhage
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One injured flesh-and-blood creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Blood suddenly gushes from the target’s wounds. The target takes 4d6 damage. Then, make an Intellect roll against the target’s Strength. On a success, the target loses 4d6 Health, and blood spraying from its body creates light obscurement within 5 yards of it. On a critical success, the target loses an extra 2d6 Health.

### Freedom Delusion
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

For a moment, the target stiffens. You can target additional creatures with this casting of the spell: lose 4 Health to target two creatures or 8 Health to target three. A target becomes cursed for the duration, or until it overcomes the affliction with a successful luck roll. While cursed in this way, each time the target takes a turn within 10 yards of you, it chooses either to become controlled by you until the end of the round or to take 4d6 damage.

### Part Bone from Flesh
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 1 flesh-and-blood creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The bones in the target’s body begin moving around. The target takes 6d6 damage. Then, make a Will roll against the target’s Strength. On a success, the target takes an extra 6d6 damage. On a critical success, the target takes an extra 12d6 damage instead. If the damage incapacitates the target, it dies and, at the end of the round, an animated skeleton of the target’s Size pulls itself free from the corpse and stands up. The animated skeleton is a creature under the Sage’s control and treats all other creatures as enemies. The Sage has rules for the animated skeleton in *Secrets*, Chapter 3.

### The Certainty of Fools
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A queer expression appears on the target’s visage. You can target additional creatures with this casting of the spell: lose 4 Health to target two creatures or 8 Health to target three. For each target separately, make a Will roll against its Intellect. On a success, the target becomes confused and Intellect impaired (luck ends both). On a critical success, the target also becomes stunned until the end of your next turn.

At the end of each round the target is impaired in this way, its Intellect score is reduced by 1. A target whose Intellect score was reduced in this way regains 1 point every 24 hours from the last time this spell reduced its Intellect score.

### Vile Tentacles
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Unfurling from thin air, three hideous tentacles covered in suckers lash your enemies. When the tentacles appear, and again at the start of each of your turns, the tentacles attack up to three creatures in the target space. For each target separately, make an Intellect roll against the target’s Agility. On a success, the target takes 3d6 damage and becomes grabbed by the tentacle. If the target is already grabbed by a tentacle, it takes an extra 3d6 damage instead and remains grabbed until the end of the tentacle’s next turn.

A tentacle counts as an object with Defense 12 and Health 10. Once three tentacles have been destroyed, the spell ends early.

**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to three creatures all in one Size 3 space within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You fling out your hands and lines crisscross the targets’ bodies. Each target takes 4d6 damage and makes a Strength roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 damage. On a critical failure, it takes an extra 8d6 damage instead. If this damage incapacitates the target, it dies, and its body slides apart into hundreds of ultrathin slices. The target’s vitality covers the ground in a Size 3 space centered on it with challenging terrain. You can choose to lose 4 Health to regain the expended casting of this spell.

## Master Spells

### Body Puppet
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The target’s body moves in an unsettling nature. If the target has Health 60 or less, it becomes cursed until you or the target dies. If you choose to lose 8 Health, you can instead affect a target with Health 100 or less; such a target becomes cursed (luck ends). When a target cursed in this way takes a turn, you can use a reaction to exert your will over the target if it is within 10 yards of you and in your line of sight. Make a Will roll against the target’s Will. On a success, the target becomes controlled by you until the start of its next turn. On a failure, the target takes 8d6 damage.

### Into the Oubliette
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You make the target a prisoner of its own body. Make a Will roll against the target’s Intellect. On a success, if the target has Health 60 or less, it becomes cursed (luck ends). While cursed in this way, the target is stunned, cannot use any of its senses, and takes half damage from all sources. When the spell ends, the target makes a Will roll, and on a failure, becomes frightened of you until you become incapacitated.

A target with a Health score greater than 60 is cursed (luck ends). While cursed in this way, the target is also held, vulnerable, and weakened.

If you get a failure on your roll, you can choose to lose 8 Health to regain the expended casting of this spell.

### Liquefy Flesh
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One flesh-and-blood creature within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The target’s skin turns to liquid and drains away. The target loses 20d6 Health. You can choose to lose 8 Health to increase the Health loss to 30d6. If the loss reduces the target’s Health score to 0, it melts into a reeking puddle that dries a few days later.

---

### Part Soul from Flesh
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 1 or smaller creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You hook your finger at the target to wrench free its soul. An angel, creation, demon, faerie, and fiend ignores this spell. A target with Health 60 or less falls prone and dies. If you choose to lose 8 Health, you can instead affect a target with Health 100 or less in this way. When the target dies, a ghost appears in the air above its body.

The ghost is a creature under the Sage’s control and treats all other creatures as enemies. The Sage has rules for the ghost in *Secrets*, Chapter 3.

### Pillars of Salt
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Any number of creatures inside a Size 5 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Salt crystals form on each target’s body. A target with Health 40 or less freezes in place, turns into salt, and then dies. If you choose to lose 8 Health, you can instead affect targets with Health 60 or less in this way. A target with a Health score greater than this threshold instead takes 10d6 damage.

---

### Release the Demon
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 1 space within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A black hole opens in the target space and from it clambers forth a type I demon. The demon is an enemy under the Sage’s control. The Sage has rules for demons. When it is incapacitated, the demon disappears.

If you choose to lose 8 Health, when the demon appears, you can make a Will roll against its Will. On a success, the demon becomes controlled by you for 1 minute, after which time it returns to the Void. On a failure, you regain the casting of this spell after 1 hour.
