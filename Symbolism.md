## Novice Spells

### Baffling Pattern
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 1 space within reach  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Using your finger, you sketch in the air a complex pattern that leaves a glowing tracery for the duration. Any creature that starts its turn with line of sight to the target space makes a Will roll. On a success, the creature becomes immune to this spell for 24 hours. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 damage and becomes confused until the start of its next turn.

### Brand of Cruelest Burning
**Castings:** 1, reaction when you get a success on a roll to attack an enemy  
**Target:** The target of your attack  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

A burning brand appears on the target’s body. The brand emits dim light and the enemy becomes impaired in an attribute of your choice and takes an extra 1d6 damage the first time it takes damage in each round until the spell ends.

### Entrapping Circle
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** The ground in one Size 5 space within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 24 hours (see the effect)  

An invisible circle forms on the ground inside the space and remains there for the duration or until activated, which ends the spell early. Any enemy moving into, within, or out of the target space makes a luck roll. On a failure, the enemy activates the circle, which causes it to radiate bright golden light up to 10 yards high and forms an impenetrable barrier around the enemy. The barrier remains until it’s destroyed; it has Health 20. Until then, nothing can pass through the barrier or climb it.

### Glyph of Destruction
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you have a writing kit and rare materials worth 5 cp  
**Target:** One secured object within reach  
**Duration:** 24 hours (see the effect)  

A 1-foot-diameter glyph appears on the target’s surface where it remains for the duration or until activated. You decide what activates the glyph: a creature, ally, or enemy, which might be a specific individual or not, touches the glyph or moves to within some distance of it.

When activated, the glyph disappears and fire fills a Size 5 space centered on its location. The fire deals 3d6 damage to each object in the space and 1d6 damage to each creature in the space. A creature makes a luck roll. On a failure, the creature takes an extra 2d6 damage.

### Mark of the Beast
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

A mark appears on the target’s body and remains there for the duration. The target becomes vulnerable, cannot benefit from invisibility, and cannot hide from you as you always know the target’s exact location.

### Rune of Unflagging Vigor
**Castings:** 1, reaction when a creature starts its turn  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

A complex rune appears on the target’s body, bolstering its endurance and courage. The target makes Strength and Will rolls with 1 boon and imposes 1 bane on rolls against its Strength and Will. When the target becomes injured, it can end the spell early to heal 2d6 damage.

## Expert Spells

### Glyph of the Illustrated Guardian
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you have a writing kit and rare materials worth 1 sp  
**Target:** One Size 1 secured object in reach  
**Duration:** 24 hours (see the effect)  

A 1-foot-diameter glyph appears on the object’s surface where it remains for the duration or until activated. You decide what activates the glyph: a creature, ally, or enemy, which might be a specific individual or not, touches the glyph or moves to within some distance of it.

Once triggered, the glyph disappears and an illustrated guardian appears on the ground within 5 yards of its location. The guardian remains for 1 hour, until it is incapacitated, or until it moves or is moved more than 5 yards from the space that contained the glyph. The guardian treats all creatures other than you and your allies as enemies. The Sage controls the guardian and uses the rules for it found in Secrets, Chapter 3.

### Protective Circle
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space centered on you  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

A magical circle scrawled with writhing runes appears on the ground in the target space. The circle hedges out something of your choice, which you choose when you cast the spell from the following options:

- A particular kind of magical creature, such as demons, fiends, angels, or undead  
- Ordinary objects  
- Cold, fire, ice, lightning, wind, water, or earth and stone  
- Allies or enemies  

Creatures, objects, or effects of the chosen kind cannot cross the circle by any means. For example, fire would not reach into the area protected by the circle, or a demon could not make attacks against creatures inside it. However, an enemy prevented from entering the circle could make ranged attacks against targets inside it.

If anything covers any part of the circle, make a luck
