## Expert Spells

### Chain Sword
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You construct in your hands a sword that comes equipped with a toothy chain. The weapon uses the rules for a sword that has the Brutal trait. When you attack with it, the chain springs to life, rotating around the blade so that your attacks with it deal an extra 3d6 damage. On a critical success, the target of your attack takes an extra 2d6 damage and becomes vulnerable (luck ends). However, the weapon creates noise loud enough to drown out speech and whispers within 5 yards of it.

### Flitter Blade
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to five creatures inside one Size 5 space within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

For each target, you fling one winged blade that zooms toward its prey. When you cast this spell and, again, at the start of each of your turns, the blades swoop down to slice their targets. Each target becomes weakened until the start of your next turn and makes an Agility roll. On a failure, the target takes 2d6 damage. A target can attack a flitter blade: it has Defense 20 and Health 5. Destroying a winged blade ends the effect for that target.

### Rolling Fortress
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 10 space on the ground within reach  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You construct a Rolling Fortress inside the target space. It is a vehicle with Defense 5, Health 200, Size 10, Speed 5 (Strider). It takes no damage from cold and half damage from ordinary sources. The vehicle is self-propelled, though it requires a driver to steer it. Creatures can enter and exit the vehicle through one of two hatches. The fortress can hold creatures and objects whose total Size does not exceed 20 and no individual creature greater than Size 2.

The fortress also comes equipped with a heavy cannon.  
A creature inside the fortress can use an action to fire the cannon, sending a projectile to a point within 100 yards. When the projectile reaches that point or can travel no further, the projectile explodes inside a Size 5 space. Each object in the space takes 7d6 damage. Each creature in it takes 3d6 damage and makes an Agility roll. On a failure, the creature takes an extra 4d6 damage, falls prone, and becomes confused and vulnerable (luck ends).

Each object in the affected space takes 10d6 damage and each unsecured object is pushed 5 yards. Each creature in the affected space takes 5d6 damage and makes a Strength roll. On a failure, it takes an extra 5d6 damage, is pushed 5 yards away, and falls prone.

When the spell ends, the fortress crumbles into challenging terrain that covers the ground in its space until cleared away.
