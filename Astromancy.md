## Novice Spells

### Captivating Lights
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 3 space within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Lights appear and dance in the target space. When an enemy starts its turn with line of sight to the target space, the enemy makes a Will roll. On a success, the enemy becomes immune to this spell for 24 hours. On a failure, the enemy becomes confused until the spell ends or until the enemy is harmed. While confused in this way, the enemy must run toward the target space on each of its turns. Once it enters the space, it will not willingly leave it. The enemy is otherwise free to act as it chooses.

## Expert Spells

### Eye in the Sky
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

If you can see the moon, you can change your visual perspective to a bird’s eye view above the moonlit lands as if you were the moon. You perceive nothing from your body except what is in plain view of the moon. You can use an action to switch perspectives so you can see from your body or from the sky as you choose, but each time you switch the perspective, reduce the remaining duration of the spell by 1 hour.  

Alternatively, you can expend 1 yard of movement and the casting of this spell to teleport to an empty space you can see.

When you attack with it, you can use Intellect or Will in place of the attribute you would normally use, you roll against the target’s Agility instead of its Defense, and if you use it as a thrown weapon, it reforms in your hand at the end of the round.
