### Betrayal of Flesh
**Castings:** 1

### Hijack Corpse
**Castings:** 1

The target retains none of the talents it had when it was alive, but retains any traits it had, including natural weapons. While in the target body, its Defense and Agility equal your Intellect score and its Strength equals your Will score. The target has a Health score of 20. Since the target does not breathe, it cannot speak. When the spell ends, your soul returns to your body.

**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 5 space within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The ground in the target space fractures as a dead dreamer pulls itself up and free, revealing itself in all its nightmarish glory. Chunks of earth and stone roll from its back to create challenging terrain on the ground within 5 yards of it. The dead dreamer is an enemy to all creatures, is under the Sage’s control, and remains until incapacitated, at which point it disappears.  

After you cast this spell, you become stunned (luck ends) and weakened until after you rest. Also, you take 3d6 damage and make a Will roll with 3 banes. On a failure, you take an extra 3d6 damage.

### Behold the Impossible
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** All creatures, other than you, within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You reveal an alien vista, crawling with horrors beyond imagining. A target makes a luck roll. On a success, the target averts its eyes. On a failure, the target becomes blinded until the end of your next turn and confused, vulnerable, and weakened (luck ends all). For 1 minute, whenever the target fails an attribute roll, it suffers from this effect again, as the alien vista swims across its vision once more.

### Beware the Black Door
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 1 space within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

A stone doorframe appears inside the target space and remains there for the duration, at which time it vanishes. Darkness prevails inside the frame. When the frame appears, pale hands reach for one creature within 3 yards of it and drag that creature into the blackness.  

A creature that moves through the frame, willingly or otherwise, vanishes into the darkness. While inside the darkness, it is trapped between worlds until it can find its way free and emerges from the door into the nearest empty space.  

A creature can attempt to escape the darkness while the door stands open. To do so, it must overcome this effect four times, once for each of its attributes. If the creature gets a failure on any of these rolls, 1d6 hours pass for it in the darkness. Any creature still inside the darkness when the spell ends must wait until another door opens from a casting of this spell, and can then resume trying to find its way free.  

After you cast this spell, make a Will roll with 3 banes. On a failure, you take 4d6 damage.

### Drone of the Insatiable Host
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space centered on you  
**Duration:** Permanent, until you end it or you die  

A horrid droning noise fills the air in the space. Each creature in it becomes Will impaired for as long as it remains there. At the end of each round, the noise grows louder, spreading out another 5 yards in all directions, and produces increasingly more severe effects as shown below. The effects are cumulative.  

- **Round 2:** Each creature in the space becomes Intellect impaired for as long as it is Will impaired.  
- **Round 3:** Each creature in the space becomes Strength and Agility impaired for as long as it is Will impaired.  
- **Round 4:** Each creature in the space becomes weakened for as long as it is Will impaired.  
- **Rounds 5+:** Each creature in the space treats all creatures as enemies and must use an action, if it can, on each turn to attack the nearest creature to it. If there is no eligible target within 5 yards of it, the creature becomes stunned and loses 10d6 Health. If this loss reduces its Health to 0, it dies and black, oily fluids spill from all the openings on its head for 1d6 minutes.  

The spell lasts indefinitely. You must end the spell and can do so only if you get a success on an Intellect roll made while in the area of noise.  

After you cast this spell, make a Will roll with 3 banes. On a failure, you take 6d6 damage.
