# Conjuration

## Novice Spells

### Conjure Helpful Servant
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 2 space within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

A faint popping noise heralds the sudden appearance of a dog, horse, or pack mule in the target space. (See *Shadow*, Chapter 3 for their rules.) The creature is friendly to you and becomes your controlled companion. If the creature becomes incapacitated, the spell ends early.

If you have a drop of blood, few hairs, or a bit of nail from a creature, you can expend the object and cause the creature to which the object belongs to appear in the target space instead. An unwilling creature can make a Will roll. On a success, the creature ignores the effect, but the object is still expended. An unwilling creature summoned in this way retains its normal disposition to you and does not become your controlled companion.

### Conjure Obstacle
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 2 space on the ground within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

Rocks, dirt, trees, and detritus fill the space around any creatures and objects in it. A creature in the space can make an Agility roll with 1 boon. On a success, the creature moves to the empty space nearest to the target space and becomes vulnerable until the end of your next turn. On a failure, the creature becomes buried (see *Shadow*, Chapter 2).

### Produce Flame
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One Size 2 space within reach  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You pluck flames from somewhere else and send them rushing out from your hands into the target space. The flames deal 3d6 damage to each object in the space, and 1d6 damage to each creature in the space. A creature makes an Agility roll. On a failure, the creature takes an extra 2d6 damage. On a critical failure, the creature catches fire (luck ends).

### Rain of Blades
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You snatch knives, daggers, forks, and other sharp things from all around and cause them to appear in the air above the target space. The blades fall and disappear after they land. Each creature and object in the space and not under hard shelter takes 2d6 damage. A creature makes a luck roll. On a failure, the creature takes an extra 1d6 damage.

---

### Secret Chest
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One container that can fit inside a Size 1 space within reach  
**Duration:** Special  

You touch the target container and leave behind your mark. You can use an action to cause the target and everything it holds to appear in an empty space on the ground within reach, which ends this spell. Otherwise, the spell lasts until you cast it on a different target.

---

### Weighty Chains
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You reach for and retrieve heavy chains with which you can bind the target. Make an Intellect roll against the target’s Strength. On a success, the chains wrap around the target and cause it to become held and weakened for the duration. The target can overcome this effect with a success on a Strength or Agility roll. On a failure, a heap of chains, 50 yards long, appears in an empty space of your choice within 1 yard of the target. The chains disappear when the spell ends.

## Expert Spells

### Convenient Shelter
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 10 space on solid ground or a liquid surface within 20 yards  
**Duration:** 12 hours  

The air in the target space darkens and returns to normal when a structure that can fit inside the space appears inside it. If you target a space on a liquid surface, a boat appears instead of a structure. The shelter contains whatever items were inside it before you conjured it.

---

### Conjure Wall
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One Size 10 space within 20 yards  
**Duration:** 12 hours  

Along one side of the space there appears a 1-yard thick wall formed from stone, iron plates, and timber. Each Size 1 cube of space has Health 40.

---

### Embed Foreign Object
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One creature within 20 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The target’s body bulges as it accepts some solid object that you caused to appear inside it. The target takes 6d6 damage, and becomes slowed and weakened (luck ends both). Each time the target gets a failure on the roll to end the afflictions, the target loses 1d6 Health.

---

### Produce Superior Item
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

The air shimmers over your hands until the object you desire appears there. You cause one superior suit of armor, weapon, or piece of gear to appear in your hands and remain for the duration.

### Spin a Spider’s Web
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Sticky strands spread through the space to fill it entirely. The strands turn the space into challenging terrain and grant creatures and objects in it partial cover. Each creature in the target space when the webs appear becomes held until the creature overcomes the effect with a successful Strength roll. A creature entering the space or moving in it must first make an Agility roll. On a failure, it becomes held as described.

The strands ignite if touched by fire and burn away at the end of the round, ending the spell early. Anything in the target space takes 2d6 damage, while creatures held by the strands in that space take an extra 2d6 damage.

---

### Surprising Boulder
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 3 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You pluck a boulder from somewhere and cause it to fill the target space. The boulder has Health 100. If you conjure the boulder in the air, it falls. The falling boulder deals 12d6 damage to all objects under it. Each creature under the boulder when it falls makes an Agility roll. A slowed creature makes the roll with 1 bane. On a success, the creature falls prone in the nearest empty space to the boulder. On a critical success, the creature does not fall prone. On a failure, the creature takes 12d6 damage, falls prone, and becomes held until it overcomes the affliction with a success on a Strength or Agility roll. A creature held in this way cannot stand up.

**Castings:** 1

### Mansion of the Mists
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual  
**Target:** One empty Size 30 space on the ground that you can see  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

You cause a mansion to appear in the target space. It has an appearance appropriate to the part of the world in which you cast this spell: it could be a manor house, a castle, a fortress, or just a nice cottage. The place comes with furnishings, and anyone in the mansion when you conjured it appears inside it. Creatures traveling with the mansion are friendly to you and your allies and try to make you as comfortable as possible for the duration of your stay.

If you own a structure and that structure is on your continent when you cast this spell, you can conjure it to appear in the target space instead of a random structure. In addition, a conjured structure you own can remain in the space indefinitely.

### Produce Lava
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space on the ground within 20 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You call forth lava from deep in the earth to spread across the ground in the target space, covering it with challenging terrain. Each creature and object on the ground in the space when the lava appears or that enters it takes 10d6 damage and catches fire (luck ends).

During the next round, and each subsequent round, the lava deals damage to any creature or object on the ground in the target space or that enters it, but the damage dealt is reduced by 2d6: 8d6 damage on round two, 6d6 on round three, and so on.

In addition to dealing damage, toxic gas rises from the lava and creates light obscurement in the target space. Creatures in the space are affected by suffocation until they leave it.

---

### Produce Magic Item
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You pluck a magical item from somewhere in the world and cause it to appear in your hands or at your feet if your hands are full. You can choose any consumable or trinket described in *Shadow*, Chapter 3. Alternatively, you can conjure a random oddity. The Sage (*Secrets*, Chapter 1) has rules for oddities.

---

### River of Rock
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature or object within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You pull rocks and debris from someplace else and cause them to come tumbling out from nowhere. A target object takes 20d6 damage and, if not secured, is pushed 5 yards. A target creature takes 10d6 damage, and makes an Agility roll. On a failure, the target takes an extra 10d6 damage, is pushed 5 yards, and falls prone. The boulders cover the ground in a 5-yard wide and 5-yard long line extending away from the target’s space with challenging terrain that remains until cleared away.

### Summon Winged Steeds
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual, you can see the sky  
**Target:** One Size 5 space centered on you  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

From the air above you swoop down winged steeds for you and each ally in the space. The steeds are friendly to you and your allies and bear you as riders. The steeds use the rules for horses (see *Shadow*, Chapter 3) with the Fly trait. If a steed becomes incapacitated, it disappears. A creature on a steed falls when the spell ends or when the steed disappears.
