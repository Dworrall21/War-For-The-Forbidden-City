Light dapples the target. Make an Intellect roll against the target’s Will. On a success, you teleport the target onto a solid surface that can support their weight in an empty space of its Size within 30 yards of you.

### Quick Jaunt
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You sense the gaps in reality and can exploit them. Gain the Teleport 5 trait for the duration.

### Remove Object
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 3 or smaller unsecured object within 10 yards that is neither worn nor carried by a creature other than you  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The target disappears for 1 minute. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left. If there is a creature or object in that space when the target returns, the returning object and the creature or object in its space each lose 3d6 Health, and the smaller of the two is pushed to the nearest empty space.

### Scatter
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to five creatures within 5 yards of you  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The targets flicker in and out of existence. For each target separately, make an Intellect roll against its Will. On a success, you teleport the target onto a solid surface in an empty space of its Size within 10 yards of you. On a critical success, the surface can be within 30 yards of you.

### Sever
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A two-dimensional portal opens in the target’s space, threatening to cut the target in half. Make an Intellect roll against the target’s Strength. On a success, the target loses 6d6 Health. On a critical success, the target loses an extra 2d6 Health. If this drops the target’s Health by half or more, it loses one of its limbs of your choice. If it reduces the target’s Health to 0, the target loses its head or an equivalent extremity and dies. Otherwise, the target becomes weakened (luck ends). If the roll results in a failure, you regain the expended casting of this spell after 1 minute.

## Master Spells

### Banish
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Reality folds in around the target, causing it to disappear for the duration. The target perceives nothing and can do nothing. When the spell ends, roll 30d6.

Otherwise, the target reappears in the space it left or the empty space nearest to it of the Sage’s choice.

### Gate
**Castings:** 1, perform a ritual  
**Target:** One Size 5 space within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You fix your mind on a Size 5 space anywhere in the world. You need not have seen this space, but it must exist. When you finish the ritual, a multicolored disk forms a portal on one side of the target space that remains open for the duration. A second portal appears on one side of the space you had in mind. Anything passing through one portal emerges from the other and vice versa.

---

### Portal Network
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Ten empty Size 1 spaces within 100 yards  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

In each space, a portal irises open. Each appears as a glowing white two-dimensional disk that sheds dim light. Number each portal from 1 to 10. Anything entering one portal instantly emerges from the portal of the next higher or lower number (chosen by the user). Depending on how the portals are arranged, it might be possible for something to pass through multiple portals. If so, it can pass through any given portal created by this spell just once per round, which might happen if the portals all appear in a stack or arranged across the ground like trapdoors.

### Sequester
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One ally or one object neither worn nor carried by a creature other than you within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

A bubble forms around the target, contracts, and disappears, carrying the target into the Void where it remains for the duration. No time passes for it. When the spell ends, the target reappears in an empty space of your choice within 5 yards of you.

### Teleportation Circle
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space centered on you  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A ring of numbers and symbols appears in the target space, marking the coordinates to one Size 5 space in a place you have seen at least once before and that exists somewhere in the world. You need no line of effect or line of sight to this space. You and each ally inside the space teleports to that space.

From your outflung hand come several flying disks, each in a variety of different colors. For each target separately, make an Intellect roll against its Agility. On a success, the disk hits the target, which causes it to take 7d6 damage and teleport to an empty space of your choice within 5 yards of the space it leaves.
