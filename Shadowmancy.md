### Midnight Razor

When you get a critical success on a roll to attack with the razor, the target also loses 2d6 Health.

## Master Spells

### Devouring Darkness
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Darkness blooms and swallows the target. The target takes 10d6 damage, and you make an Intellect roll against the target’s Strength. On a success, the target takes an extra 8d6 damage and becomes blinded (luck ends). On a critical success, the target takes an extra 10d6 damage and becomes blinded (luck ends) instead. In either case, each time the target gets a failure on a luck roll to remove the blinded affliction, it takes 5d6 damage.

### Obsidian Gate
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 1 space within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You punch through reality causing a black hole to open inside the target space. When you cast the spell, and again when you use an action to do so while you are within 5 yards of the target space, you can choose one empty Size 1 space anywhere in the world that you have seen at least once before and cause a second hole to open there. Until you choose a different space, anything entering one hole instantly emerges from the other.

If the hole has no exit, anything that enters it makes a luck roll. On a success, it emerges from the other side of the target space. On a failure, it disappears, never to be seen again.

### Shadow Killer
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty Size 1 space within 10 yards lit by dim light, faint light, or no light at all  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

The shadows in that space form into a monstrous killer. The shadow killer becomes your controlled companion for the duration, but the spell ends early if it becomes incapacitated.

### Shrieking Darkness
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 20 space within 30 yards  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

Magical darkness fills the space with total obscurement. You ignore the effects of this obscurement on your vision. A creature that would move out of the target space first makes an Intellect roll and, on a failure, becomes lost in the space and cannot attempt to exit until the start of its next turn.

From the darkness come sounds of terrible shrieking. Each creature in the darkness or within 10 yards of it, other than you, makes a Will roll. On a success, the creature becomes immune to this aspect of the spell for 24 hours. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened of the darkness (luck ends).

At the end of each round, each creature in the target space, other than you, makes a luck roll. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 damage and becomes held until the end of its next turn. While held in this way, the creature is also Will impaired.

### Slicing Shadows
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 5 space within 30 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Blades of solidified darkness crisscross the target space and dissipate. The blades deal 5d6 damage to each creature in the target space. A creature that takes this damage makes an Agility roll with 1 bane. On a failure, it takes an extra 5d6 damage. A creature that becomes injured by this damage takes 2d6 damage at the end of each round (luck ends).

---

### Steal Shadow
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

A horrible tearing sounds as you rip away the target’s shadow. The target no longer casts a shadow. You always know the target’s location in relation to your own. For your attacks, spells, and talents, you can target the shadow, which squirms somewhere in your reach until the spell ends, instead of the target creature and the effects apply to that creature regardless of the distance between you. The shadow uses the target’s Defenses and attributes. Each time you harm the target through its stolen shadow, the target makes a Will roll with 1 bane; on a success, the spell ends early.

In addition, until the spell ends, you make rolls against the target with 1 boon, you impose 1 bane on rolls the target makes against you, and your attacks against the target deal an extra 5d6 damage.
