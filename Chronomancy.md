# Chronomancy

## Novice Spells

### An Extra Moment
**Castings:** 1, reaction when a creature within 5 yards ends its turn  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Time speeds up for the target. The target gains one action that it must use immediately. The target makes any rolls from using this action with 1 boon. Then, the target makes a luck roll. On a failure, the target becomes confused and slowed (luck ends both).

---

### Displace From Time
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Make a luck roll. On a success, the target winks out of existence. The target is removed from time (luck ends). While removed from time, the only thing the target can do is make the luck roll to end this effect. When the target gets a success on its luck roll, it reappears in the space it vacated or in an empty space of its choice nearest to that space. You then make a luck roll. On a failure, you become held (luck ends). If you get a failure on the initial luck roll, you become affected by the spell instead of the target.

---

### Entangle Timeline
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

The target sees its future and past unspool around it and becomes surrounded by conflicting images of scenes that might have happened or not. The target becomes confused and vulnerable for the duration. While confused in this way, you trap the target in a Size 5 space centered on it. If the target attempts to move out of the space, it stops and its Speed drops to 0 until the start of its next turn.

At the end of each round, you and the target make an Intellect roll. If you get a failure, you become confused until the end of the next round. If the target gets a failure, it becomes stunned until the end of the next round. The spell ends early if the target is harmed by an effect other than this one.

---

### Entrap in a Time Loop
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 10 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You seize the target’s timeline and wrap it around the target. The target becomes confused and held (luck ends both). While confused, the target must use an action on each of its turns to perform the same activity it performed during the previous round. If the target would be prevented from doing so—no eligible target for its attack, no uses remaining for its talent, and so on—the target does nothing on its turn and takes 2d6 damage.

After you cast this spell, make a luck roll. On a failure, you teleport to an empty space on a surface that can bear your weight of the Sage’s choice within 10 yards.

---

### Fling Through Time
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One creature within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The target disappears. Make an Intellect roll and note the result. At the end of each round, roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from your result. When the result drops to 0 or less, the target reappears in the space it vacated or an empty space nearest to it. When the target reappears, make a luck roll. On a failure, you become stunned until the end of your next turn.

---

### Fold Space
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One Size 5 space centered on you and one Size 5 space within 30 yards  
**Duration:** 1 round  

Time and space warp so that creatures in each space can clearly see into and hear from the other space. Both spaces count as being adjacent to each other, such that when a creature moves out of one space it enters the other, and vice versa. When the spell ends, make a luck roll. On a failure, you become confused (luck ends).

---

### Inescapable Past
**Castings:** 1, reaction when a creature within 15 yards takes damage  
**Target:** The creature that enabled the casting of this spell  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The target’s body recalls previous injuries and manifests them. The target takes 3d6 damage. Then, you make a luck roll. On a failure, you take half the damage taken by the target.

---

### Momentary Respite
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** Special (see the effect)  

You attempt to pull yourself out of time. Make an Intellect roll. On a success, you move yourself out of time and into a dark extradimensional space. An hour passes in that space, but no time passes in the world. While in that space you can cast spells and perform other activities, but you cannot target anything other than yourself with spells, talents, or other effects. You can end the spell at any time, at which point you return to the space you left. If you get a failure on the Intellect roll, you become confused (luck ends) and you regain the expended casting of this spell after 1 minute.

---

### Slow the Clock
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to three creatures within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Each target seems to move as if trapped in treacle. The target becomes confused, slowed, and weakened for the duration, or until it overcomes the affliction with a success on a Will roll. After you cast this spell, make a luck roll. On a failure, you become weakened (luck ends). You make the luck roll to end the affliction with 1 bane for each creature you targeted.

---

### Speed the Clock
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** Up to three creatures within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You accelerate each target. The target makes attribute and luck rolls with 1 boon, imposes 1 bane on rolls made to attack it and rolls against it, and the target’s Speed increases by 5. After you cast this spell, make a luck roll. On a failure, you become held (luck ends).

---

### Temporal Distortion
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One enemy within 10 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Time flows in an erratic fashion for the target. Make a luck roll. On a failure, you also target yourself for this spell’s effects. The target emits dim light and becomes Agility impaired and vulnerable (luck ends). Until the afflictions end, the target can use an action or move on each of its turns, but not both.

## Expert Spells

### Create Paradox
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 10 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

A shimmering, undulating tangle of tortured time appears in the center of the target space. When you cast the spell, and again at the start of each of your turns, choose three different numbers between 1 and 20, so that on the second round, you have chosen six numbers, nine numbers on the third, and so on. You can choose a number that was chosen on a previous turn.

When a creature in the target space makes an attribute roll or luck roll and the number rolled on the die matches a number you have chosen, discard the number you chose and the target is removed from time until the spell ends. A creature so removed does nothing.

At the spell’s end, roll a d6 for each creature removed from time by this spell:

| D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | The creature remains removed from time. The only thing the creature can do is to make a luck roll once every 24 hours. On a success, the creature returns to an empty space within 5 yards of the target space. If the creature gets three failures, it is never seen again and memories of it eventually fade from the world. |
| 2 | The creature appears in an empty space of its choice within 5 yards of the target space and makes a Will roll. On a failure, the creature becomes stunned (luck ends). |
| 3 | The creature reappears in an empty space of its choice within the target space and takes 6d6 damage. |
| 4 | The creature reappears in an empty space of its choice inside the target space. |
| 5 | The creature reappears in an empty space inside the target space and heals 6d6 damage. |
| 6 | The creature and a duplicate of it appear in empty spaces inside the target space. The creature’s possessions, if it has any, appear in a pile on the ground in an empty space of your choice. The creature and its duplicate use the same rules, but regard each other as enemies. When one becomes incapacitated, it ceases to exist, but, while they both exist, each loses 1d6 Health at the end of each round. |

## Master Spells

### Stop Time
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 10 space centered on you  
**Duration:** Special (see the effect)  

You halt time in the target space. Each object in the target space, other than ones you wear or carry, or that enters it becomes secured, even in the air, and immune to harm. Each creature other than you in the space or that enters it becomes an object until the spell ends. Ongoing effects in the target space are suspended until time resumes. Rounds spent in the space of stopped time do not count against durations.

You can freely enter and exit the affected space. You can use an action to move creatures and objects in the space, but you must get a success on a Strength roll with 1 bane to do so and, then, you move the creature or object 1 yard. The Sage might impose 1 or more additional banes on the roll depending on size and material composition. If you push a creature or object out of the affected space, time resumes for it.

At the end of each round, you can allow the spell to end or make a Will roll. On a success, the spell lasts until the end of the next round. On a failure, it ends immediately.

---

### Summon Self
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One empty space of your Size on the ground within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

In the target space, your future self appears before you. The spell ends early if you or your duplicate become unconscious. The spell produces the following effects:

- You and the duplicate are identical, using the same attributes and having access to the same traits, talents, and spells. However, you share the same pool of uses and castings.  
- Your duplicate has a copy of everything you wear and carry. If you drop an object, the copied object disappears from the duplicate. If an object you wear or carry is destroyed, it too is destroyed for the duplicate. Similarly, any wear and tear, dirt, or dampness that applies to you also applies to your other.  
- You each take a turn during the round.  
- You count as one creature for the purpose of tracking damage and Health. If one takes damage or loses Health, the damage or loss applies to both.  
- If either of you becomes incapacitated, the other becomes so as well. If you die, your duplicate disappears.

When the spell ends, you and the future version of yourself vanish. After 1 minute, you reappear in the space you vacated, or an empty space nearest to that space.

### Temporal Surge
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You and any number of allies within 5 yards  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

Time speeds up for each target, causing the rest of the world to appear in slow motion. Each target can take one additional turn per round. At the end of each round after you cast this spell, make a Will roll. On a failure, you choose to either lose 2d6 Health or end the spell early.

---

### Time Bomb
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** One Size 1/2 space within 15 yards  
**Duration:** Special (see the effect)  

A warbling sphere appears inside the target space. You decide how long it remains, up to a maximum of 6 rounds. When you cast the spell, and on each of your turns until the spell ends, the time bomb gains 1 charge. When the spell ends, the bomb explodes, dealing 5d6 damage per charge accumulated to each creature and object within 10 yards of it. A creature makes a luck roll. On a success, the creature takes half the damage.

---

### Time Travel
**Castings:** 1  
**Target:** You  
**Duration:** Special (see the effect)  

You step into the future, appearing to all others to have vanished. Choose an amount of time in rounds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years. When the chosen amount of time passes, you reappear in the space you left and become weakened (luck ends). If something occupies that space when you reappear, you take 5d6 damage, fall prone in the nearest empty space to that space, and also become stunned (luck ends).

---

### Time’s March Toward Oblivion
**Castings:** 3  
**Target:** One creature within 5 yards  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You accelerate the rate at which the target ages. Angels, demons, faeries, fiends, spirits, and other immortal creatures ignore this effect. The target becomes slowed, vulnerable, and weakened (luck ends all). Each time the target gets a failure on the roll to end the afflictions, the target takes 6d6 damage. If the target becomes incapacitated, it dies and turns to dust. Once the target ends the afflictions, it returns to its normal age.
